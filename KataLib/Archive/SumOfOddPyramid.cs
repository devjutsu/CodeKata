    // Okay, here's how I derived the mathmatical formula to solve this kata.
    // It was a fun journey, even though it feels like I took the long way. 
    // Eventually ending up at the perfect solution was well worth it!
    //
    // 1 |         1
    // 2 |       3   5
    // 3 |     7   9  11
    // 4 |   13  15  17  19
    // 5 | 21  23  25  27  29
    // ...
    //
    // An important thing to know is the number that the requested row [n]
    // starts with. That provides a great anchor point for computing the
    // sum of the row. So finding that number is what I started out with.
    //
    // Given for example [n] = 4, rows 1, 2 and 3 must be skipped.
    // Those contain respectively 1, 2 and 3 odd numbers, which means that in
    // total 6 odd numbers must be skipped, in order to get to the starting
    // odd number 13 for row 4.
    // 
    // The number of odd numbers to skip can be computed, based on the row
    // number [n]. For [n] = 4, look again at the part of the triangle that has
    // to be skipped, only formatted a bit differently:
    //
    //   | .
    //   |   .
    // 1 |  1   .
    // 2 |  3  5   . 
    // 3 |  7  9  11  .
    //   +--------------
    //
    // Is can in fact be represented as a simple triange. Let's extend it into a rectangle.
    //
    //   | .x  x  x      ^     The rectangle has height [n] and width [n] - 1
    //   |   . x  x      |
    // 1 |  1   . x     [n]
    // 2 |  3  5   .     |
    // 3 |  7  9  11  .  v
    //   +--------------
    //   <-- [n]-1 -->
    //
    // This makes it clear how we can compute the surface of the triangle,
    // which represents the number of odds to skip! It's half the surface of
    // the above rectangle:
    //
    //   [skip] = ([n] - 1) * [n] / 2
    //
    // Given that we start at odd number 1 and have [skip] odds to skip, the
    // following formula delivers us the starting number for row [n]:
    //
    //   [start] = 1 + [skip] * 2 
    //
    // Okay, this is going very well. We know the odd number that the
    // requested row starts with. Let's see if this indeed works out as intended...
    //
    //   given [n] = 4
    //   [skip] = (4 - 1) * 4 / 2 = 6
    //   [start] = 1 + 6 * 2 = 13
    //
    // Hurray! Row 4 does start with 13, so we're on track. Now we have to find a
    // way to compute the total for row 4, which looks like:
    //
    //   13 + 15 + 17 + 19
    //
    // We might be tempted to simply write a loop here, which produces the values
    // of the row, after which they are added up to find the row sum. Let's no go
    // that way. Instead, we can also split this problem into two separate computations:
    //
    //   13 + 13 + 13 + 13
    //         2 +  4 +  6 + 
    //   -----------------
    //                  64
    //
    // See what I did there? I basically split the computation into two
    // surface computations: a rectangular one and a triangular one.
    // These two can be added up to get to the total for row 4.
    //
    // The surface of the rectangular part can simply be computed using:
    //
    //   [rectangle surface] = [n] * [start]
    //
    // For the triangular part, we have a triangle that can be represented like this:
    //    .
    //   1  . x x x   ^
    //   1  . x x x   |
    //   1 1  . x x   2 * ([n] - 1)
    //   1 1  . x x   |
    //   1 1 1  . x   |
    //   1 1 1  . x   v
    //   <---[n]--> 
    //
    // So the surface of the triangular part can be computed using:
    //
    //   [triangle surface] = [n] * (2 * ([n] - 1)) / 2
    //                      = [n] * ([n] - 1)
    //
    // Combining the rectangular en triangular parts brings us:
    //
    //   [sum of row] = [rectangle surface] + [triangle surface] 
    //                = [n] * [start] + [n] * ([n] - 1)
    //                = [n] * [start] + [n]^2 - [n]
    //
    // Substituting [start]:
    // 
    //   [sum of row] = [n] * (1 + [skip] * 2) + [n]^2 - [n]
    //
    // Substituting [skip]:
    //
    //   [sum of row] = [n] * (1 + (([n] - 1) * [n] / 2) * 2) + [n]^2 - [n]
    //
    // Okay, wow, man, hold on... this must be simplified.
    //
    //   [sum of row] = [n] * (1 + ([n] - 1) * [n]) + [n]^2 - [n]
    //                = [n] * (1 + [n]^2 - [n]) + [n]^2 - [n]
    //                = [n] + [n]^3 - [n]^2 + [n]^2 - [n]
    //                = [n]^3
    //
    // That's what I call simplified!!
    // So the final outcome of my journey, is the following formula:
    //
    //   Given row number [n] in the triangle of consecutive odd numbers,
    //   the row sum is [n]^3
    //
    // Okay, let's write up some code to make that work...
    //
